#### "preferred" devices (#106)

Users can now specify the preferred console per account. This is useful when, for example, you have multiple PSN users in your home and multiple PS4's or multiple PS5's. This new option lets you define a preferred device per account.

```yaml
- username: MyPsnUser
  npsso: '!secret my_npsso'
  preferred_ps5: 70C881D600B0      # ID of the PS5 that will be preferred when activity can be matched to multiple PS5's 
  preferred_ps4: 60E899D600B0      # ID of the PS4 that will be preferred when activity can be matched to multiple PS4's







```
You can find the ID of your PlayStation device by:

## 1.0.1 - 2022-08-19

### What‚Äôs changed

#### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fix PS4 title activity not being matched to PS5 devices @FunkeyFlo (#29)

## 1.0.0 - 2022-08-11

### What‚Äôs changed

### üö® New functionality

Matching PSN account activity to consoles is now supported.

The add-on will create a new `sensor.my_playstation_activity` sensor that tells you which app/game is being used on the console! Both entities, `activity` and `power`, will now include the following attributes:
| Attribute | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `Players`  | A list of players active on the device |
| `Activity` / sensor.state | `idle`, `playing` or `none`; indicating the kind of activity on the device |
| `Title Name` | A user-friendly name of the Playstation App / Game currently in use. |
| `Title Image` | A `url` referring to the official box-art. |
| `Title ID` | unique code for the Playstation App / Game currently in use. |

Take a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/FunkeyFlo/ps5-mqtt/blob/main/add-ons/ps5-mqtt-edge/DOCS.md#psn_accounts-optional-multiple) to see how to configure the add on for tracking PSN accounts and how to acquire the required information.

#### Examples

‚ö† The MQTT implementation saw some changes that might cause you to have duplicate `power` entities in HA after upgrading. ‚ö†

- The advised upgrade path is to remove your old devices from Home Assistant and let the add-on rediscover them for you.
- Alternatively remove the old `power` entity and rename the *new* `power` entity (which will probably be called something like `switch.my_ps5_power_2`) to your old entity's name.

### üöÄ Enhancements

- Psn-presence @FunkeyFlo (#26)

### üìö Documentation

- Update HA Core Docs @matt8707 (#24)
- Add HA Core Docs @FunkeyFlo (#23)
- Psn-presence @FunkeyFlo (#26)

## 0.7.1 - 2022-08-04

### What‚Äôs changed

- üí™ #22: PS4 devices were *unintentionally* being discovered as [@bryeartem](https://github.com/bryeartem) correctly pointed out. He also mentioned that, in his case, the add-on detects state changes in the PS4 quicker than the HA integration. So instead of 'fixing' the issue I decided to add an extra option (`include_ps4_devices`) to the config. Turning the option on will discover PS4 devices as well as PS5's. The option is disabled by default.

## 0.7.0 - 2022-08-03

### What‚Äôs changed

- üîß #21: fixed failing device state checks when PS5 name contained **non**-alphanumeric or '-' and '_' characters.
- üîê improved add-on security (rating) by adding ingress support.
- üíî removed `ps5_credentials` option from add-on configuration.

## 0.6.4 - 2022-07-30

## 0.6.3

- Switched to images instead of locally built Dockerfiles [#3](https://github.com/FunkeyFlo/ps5-mqtt/issues/3).

### **‚ö† IMPORTANT FOR USERS UPGRADING FROM `v0.6.2` ‚ö†**

Because the add-on switched from locally built Dockerfiles to pre-built images you *have* to **uninstall** and **re-install** the add-on to upgrade! ‚ö† Be sure to backup your configuration first because Home Assistant *will not* save it for you!

## 0.6.2

- Added a Web UI to acquire credentials through the Add-on itself.
  
- Credentials file will now be written to the file `/config/ps5-mqtt/credentials.json`.
  
- ‚ö† **Deprecation Warning**
  
- - The `ps5_credentials` option is deprecated and will be removed with the next *[minor](https://semver.org/)* release. Check the [docs](/ps5-mqtt/DOCS.md) for migration options.

## 0.5.2

- Fixed issue where MQTT traffic could cause a loop, starving the MQTT broker.

## 0.5.0

- Changed MQTT implementation to...
  
- - ...reduce amount of messages being sent.
  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- - ...avoid entities being unavailable after home assistant restart. ([#5](https://github.com/FunkeyFlo/ps5-mqtt/issues/5))

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- Re-implemented device discovery
  
- - Added `device_discovery_interval` option to change the frequency of discovering PS5 devices.

- 
- Various minor tweaks and improvements.
  

## 0.4.4

- Changed config to ensure mqtt is ready before service starts.

## 0.4.3

- Changed device discovery to only run once during startup to reduce CPU usage. To discover new devices you will have to restart the add-on.
- Added `device_check_interval` option to change the frequency of checking the PS5's status.
- Reduced the frequency of mqtt updates by only sending an update when device state actually changed.
- Added a delay between device registration in Home Assistant and sending the first availability update to solve [issue](https://github.com/FunkeyFlo/ps5-mqtt/issues/1) where after discovery the power entity would remain unavailable.
