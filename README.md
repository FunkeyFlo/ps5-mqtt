[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFunkeyFlo%2Fps5-mqtt)

## Features
The following features have been implemented or are planned for future implementation.

| Feature                                            | Implemented |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Power; Wake/Standby (rest mode)                    | âœ”           |
| Discover Playstation 5 devices on local network    | âœ”           |
| [Web UI for acquiring credentials][credentials-ui] | âœ”           |
| Match [PSN account activity][1.0.0] to device      | âœ”           |

## Installation
1. Install an [MQTT broker][mqtt-broker], if you haven't already.
2. Add the repository to Home Assistant using the repository's url or by pressing the *add-repostory* button above.
3. Install the PS5 MQTT add-on. **Not the edge version!**.
4. Configure the add-on as described in the [documentation][ha-docs].
5. Start the add-on.
6. Use the web-ui to authenticate with each PlayStation device.

The MQTT entities will be created automatically when a new device is discovered on your network. 

*Note: this does require MQTT auto-discovery to be enabled.* 

## Using the add-on with Home Assistant Core (`Docker`)
This bit of [documentation][docker-docs] should get you on your way! ðŸ˜»

## FAQ

### The log is showing 403 errors when I try to turn my ps5 on or off!
Double check that you've enabled all required remote play features [as described in the remote play documentation][ps5-rp].

### Why does this add-on only support Awake/Standby on Playstation 4?
There already is a great [Home Assistant integration][ha-ps4] that supports more functionality for PS4 devices like starting games. However, users have reported that this add-on detects Awake/Standby changes faster than the existing integration. So if you want you can use this add-on next to the existing integration or instead of it, if you are only interested in Standby/Awake.

### Can I get the yaml code for button in the [example image](#example-usage)?
**No.** I based my personal custom button cards on [this project][matt8707-dash]. *But* I *heavily* modified them and added loads of custom stuff that is not suitable for sharing at this time as it will likely raise more questions than provide answers.

## Thanks & Credits
The initial MQTT implementation for tracking device power was based on the work done by [andrew-codes][ac-user] and can be found in [this repository][ac-repo].
