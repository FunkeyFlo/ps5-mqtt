## FAQ

### Why doesn't this add-on support Playstation 4 devices?
Because there is a great [Home Assistant integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ps4/) that does this job already!

## Thanks & Credits
The majority of the MQTT implementation was based on the work done by [andrew-codes](https://github.com/andrew-codes) and can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/andrew-codes/home-automation).
