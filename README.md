## FAQ

### I'm trying to update to version `0.6.3` but the installation is failing!
Version `0.6.3` saw a switch from locally built Dockerfiles to pre-built images. Supervisor seems to not handle this upgrade properly. Instead you'll have to uninstall the add-on first and then re-install. You can follow the steps described in the [edge version documentation](https://github.com/FunkeyFlo/ps5-mqtt/tree/main/add-ons/ps5-mqtt-edge#updating-the-edge-add-on) for this.

### The log is showing 403 errors when I try to turn my ps5 on or off!
Double check that you've enabled all required remote play features [as described in the remote play documentation](https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/en/ps5_mobile.html#section3).

### Why doesn't this add-on support Playstation 4 devices?
Because there is a great [Home Assistant integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ps4/) that does this job already!
